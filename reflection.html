&nbsp<br><p>In this world of Web development and Web designing the major thing kept in mind while developing websites is its appearance to user and the comfortability that user gets while working on website or using the website and this whole design gets or turns to a lack hole when the same website is run on different sized screen i.e. mobile, tablet, desktop and laptops Which affects the efficiency while working on it  and content display to the user and sometimes even whole website and its design gets distorted while testing it on another screen and This problem in web development is overcome by a special technique in web world  called “Responsive web Designing (RWD)” and this technique is defined as Responsive web design (RWD) is a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it and this technique in html is implemented with help of CSS.</p>
<p>
RWD relates very closely with the web technologies and the relation for every web developing learner is important as if it is not developed the website may fail to run or may lose its appearance on different display sizes automatically without changing any background html code. So, today a developer no longer needs to write different websites for different sizes of display on which content is to be displayed and this also, makes other factors such as</p>
<ol>
<li> 1.Cost effectiveness</li><br>
<li>2.	Flexibility </li><br>
<li>3.	Improved user experience</li><br>
<li>4.	Search engine optimization gains</li><br>
<li>5.	Ease of management</li><br>
</ol>
<p>
And all of these above factors directly relate with web development and developers as they now days no longer need to update the web sites to different sizes and make them easy to manage by designer and easy to use for user.<p>After learning about responsive web designs and web designing, I learned its importance of being presence in each and every website being developed modernly as being in existence in field of web designing is very important as these websites are easy to maintain and more easy to make changes in updating website in future as we developers will no longer need to take care of web appearance on different devices after updating as its by default build with responsive design by default and moreover, its important to be and learn the latest version of everything so, I think every new learner should be well equipped with RWD use and its implementing.</p>
<p>Overall, this whole course WEB222 is best course for new learner of HTML, CSS, and Java script. Above that having a perfect teacher like Tanvir Alam make this course more interesting as it begins with introduction to java script which helps each student to work in the background of websites and control the events like onload, function calling such as onclick, on mouse hover, etc. and make learner intro to back end development and explains the responsibilities of back end engineer.Moreover,This course briefly make learner learn about front-end developing and teaches HTML with all details and almost all elements and their implementation and To enhance these Html pages, this course teaches RWD,creating forms , tables ,lists, in web page and to enhance these elements to professional look this course teaches use of CSS in Html and using script in html.</p>
<p>However, this course is complete introduction to web development world and makes learner experience the HTML language in front and backend.</p>
